> Hosted bot: [@dwgrambot](https://t.me/dwgrambot)

This bot is a successor of [kifilesgram](https://github.com/ShiSHcat/kifilesgram)

This bot will let you easily have links out of telegram messages directly from the telegram app.
## Install on Linux / MacOS / BSD
NOTE: you need to have git installed.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ShiSHcat/dwgrambot.git
mv config.example.json config.json
```
(if you don't have git you can just [download the zip](https://github.com/ShiSHcat/dwgrambot/archive/master.zip), extract it and rename config.example.json to config.json)

## Configuration
Edit config.json with the right data.
## Running
You need to have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org). I advice downloading it through [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

Start with `node index.js` .
